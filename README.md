# NC News Front End React App

[Hosted App on Netlify](https://tb-nc-news.netlify.com/)

This is my implementation of a front-end for Northcoders News. It is powered by my back-end implementation which is [hosted on Heroku](https://tb-news.herokuapp.com/api)

Northcoders News is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Based on reddit.com

Users can up/down vote on articles & comments.
Users can post comments on articles and delete their own comments.

Users are hardcoded as no users endpoint in BE, but selecting a user will update the currently "logged-in" user to reflect across the whole site.
